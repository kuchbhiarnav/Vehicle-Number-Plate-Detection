### Introduction
This repository is dedicated to the development and implementation of a robust system for detecting and recognizing vehicle number plates. This technology is valuable in various applications, including traffic management, law enforcement, and parking systems.

### Key Features
1. License Plate Recognition (LPR): The system employs advanced computer vision techniques to locate and extract license plates from images or video streams.
2. Accuracy: The model is trained to achieve high accuracy in recognizing alphanumeric characters on license plates, even in challenging real-world conditions.
3. Scalability: The architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing easy integration into existing surveillance systems or other applications.

### Latest Model

As the .keras file of the trained model is huge enough to be uploaded on GitHub, you can access it through the Google Drive link present below:
